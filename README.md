## Features

### Save File Repair
- **Fix Drones** – Automatically detects and removes drones with invalid movement targets that cause save corruption
- **Remove All Drones** – Completely removes all drone entities from your save file
- **Non-destructive** – Original save files are backed up with `_original.sav` suffix before modifications

### Session Management
- **Browse Sessions** – View all your Star Rupture save sessions in one place
- **Copy Saves** – Transfer save files between different game sessions
- **Delete Sessions** – Remove entire game sessions with confirmation protection

### FTP Integration
- **Upload Saves** – Sync your save files to a remote FTP server
- **Download Saves** – Retrieve save files from your FTP server
- **Secure Storage** – FTP credentials encrypted using Windows DPAPI
- **FTPS Support** – Explicit TLS encryption for secure transfers

### Additional Features
- **Auto-detection** – Automatically locates your Steam save game folder
- **Auto-updates** – Checks GitHub for new releases and notifies you when updates are available
- **Progress Logging** – Real-time feedback during all operations
- **Diagnostic Logging** – Comprehensive logs saved to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SRSM\` for troubleshooting

## Interface

The application provides a tabbed interface with five main sections:
1. **Save Browser** – View and fix save files
2. **Session Manager** – Manage game sessions
3. **FTP Upload** – Upload saves to remote server
4. **FTP Download** – Download saves from remote server
5. **Settings** – Configure paths and FTP credentials

## Requirements

- Windows x64
- .NET 8.0 Runtime (or use the self-contained release)

## Installation

### Option 1: Download Release (Recommended)
Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/AlienXAXS/StarRupture-Save-Fixer/releases) page or the [StarRupture Utilities Website](https://starrupture-utilities.com)

### Option 2: Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AlienXAXS/StarRupture-Save-Fixer.git
cd StarRupture-Save-Fixer

# Build the project
dotnet build -c Release

# Or publish as a single self-contained executable
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true
```

## Usage

1. **Launch the application** – Run `StarRuptureSaveFixer.exe`
2. **Select a session** – Your save sessions are automatically detected and listed
3. **Choose a save file** – Select the save you want to fix or manage
4. **Apply fixes** – Click "Fix Drones" or "Remove All Drones" as needed

The application automatically backs up your original save before making any changes.

## Save File Location

Star Rupture save files are typically located at:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\<steam-id>\1631270\remote\Saved\SaveGames\
```

The application automatically detects this path. If auto-detection fails, you can set a custom path in Settings.

## How It Works

Star Rupture save files use a custom compressed format:
1. **4-byte header** – Contains the uncompressed JSON size (little-endian)
2. **zlib wrapper** – 2-byte header (0x78 0x9C)
3. **Deflate payload** – Compressed JSON game data
4. **Adler32 checksum** – 4-byte integrity check

The tool:
1. Reads and decompresses the save file
2. Parses the JSON structure to locate entity data
3. Identifies problematic entities (drones with invalid movement targets)
4. Removes or repairs the identified issues
5. Recompresses with proper zlib format and saves the fixed file

## Configuration

Application settings are stored at:
```
%APPDATA%\StarRuptureSaveFixer\settings.json
```

FTP passwords are encrypted using Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI) for security.

Diagnostic logs are stored at:
```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\SRSM\YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss.log
```

Log files contain detailed information about all operations performed by the application, including:
- FTP/SFTP connection attempts and file transfers
- Save file loading, processing, and saving operations
- Application errors and warnings
- Session management activities

**Note**: Passwords are never logged for security. Log files are created per session and include timestamps for easy troubleshooting.
